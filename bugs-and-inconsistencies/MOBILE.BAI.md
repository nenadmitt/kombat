## 2026-07-17 - Ludo captures stat resets on reconnect

- **Where:** `apps/mobile/src/games/ludo/useMultiplayerLudo.ts`
  (`myCaptures` accumulates from pushes only).
- **Why it's wrong:** the REST snapshot has no capture history, so a
  mid-match reconnect zeroes the result-screen CAPTURES stat.
- **Suggested fix:** track per-player capture counts in the server match
  state and expose them in the snapshot + moved payloads (same pattern as
  battleship's volley stats).
